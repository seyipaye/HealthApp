**HEALTHAPP**

HealthApp is a system built to bridge the communication gap between the students and the health centre at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta.

The goal behind this system is to create a means for students to get quick response especially in times of emergencies, reducing the fatality rate in the process.

This repository holds one of the client-side code for the project that has three parts to it:

1.  Client-side web for the health centre
2.  Mobile app for the students
3.  Alarm system for the health centre

In this code base, you will find the code that connect the users to the system 

The code is written in Java

We are committed to improving the project beyond what we have at submission for the Solutions challenge. Hence, new code will be pushed to the  **staging**.
